# BMPEdit
Image editing program for bmp files. Editing did with a custom made C-Programm. Graphical user interface did with C# (WFA).

You can either use the program with the graphical user interface or just the console application.

You have to use the bmpEdit22.exe to use the program as a console application.

In the Windows cmd you can type for example:

bmpEdit22 input.bmp output.bmp editletter

Editletter:
n = negative
h = brightness + value in percent --> bmpEdit22 input.bmp output.bmp h 120 --> 20% brighter
x = mirror horizontal
y = mirror vertikal
s = black and white mode

If you wonder how the programm works or if you want to add new features to the programm, feel free to take a look in the code (bmpEdit22.c) and edit it.
